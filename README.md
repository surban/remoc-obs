# Remoc-obs â€” remotely observable collection types

## **This crate is deprecated:** Remoc-obs has been integrated into [Remoc] as of version 0.10. Please update your references to use the [`remoc::robs`] module. Development continues as part of the [Remoc repository]. 

## Overview
This crate provides collections that emit an event for each change.
This event stream can be sent to a local or remote endpoint (using [Remoc]),
where it can be either processed event-wise or a mirrored collection can
be built from it.

The following observable types are implemented:
  * vector
  * append-only list
  * hash map
  * hash set
